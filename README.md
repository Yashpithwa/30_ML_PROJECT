# 30_ML_PROJECT
# 🎯 30 Days, 30 Machine Learning Projects – Python Edition

Welcome to my Machine Learning Bootcamp Challenge — **30 Days, 30 ML Concepts + Projects**.  
This repository is a hands-on journey where I explore one important ML concept each day and build a mini project around it using Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and real-world datasets.

---

## 📘 What This Challenge Covers

- 🔍 One core ML concept daily (with all its key subtypes)
- 🛠️ Practical tasks: Learn → Apply → Practice
- 📊 One real-world mini project each day
- 📂 Jupyter notebooks for each day
- 📈 Visualizations, EDA, and preprocessing explained clearly
- 🧠 Final deployment-ready project on Day 30
